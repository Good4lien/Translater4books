All my atrocities come by way of reciprocity
[1st line is this words played backward]

I'm chewing the bones of my own reprieve
Death be my dignity
Execute hemlock philosophy
Poison fills the cup of the carpenter

No
Love lost on me
More
Life so costly

No reason
For grieving

No
Love lost on me
More
Life so costly

Bring me down with
Seven point six two at high velocity

[Chorus:]
I can see them everywhere, they're
All around me they're
Waiting for me
Descending, unrelenting
Beauty of annihilation

Your curiosity
Feeding off my animosity

And reason
Is treason

Down with all that's good and clean
And you can't fucking annihilate me

Bring you down with
Seven point nine two and no impunity

[Chorus:]
I can see them everywhere, they're
All around me
They're waiting for me
Descending, unrelenting
Beauty of annihilation

Death so beautiful
Looks so beautiful
Death so beautiful
Looks so beautiful on me

I can see them everywhere
I can see them everywhere I go

I can see them everywhere, they're
All around me
They're waiting for me

I can see them everywhere
I can see them everywhere I go

I can see them everywhere they're
All around me they're
Waiting for me
Descending, unrelenting

Beauty of annihilation
Looks like your prophet was mistaken
Is life really gone or just been wasted
Death so close that I can taste it
